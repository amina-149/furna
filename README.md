I recently built a furniture e-commerce website using Java, where the admin and customer sections are separate. The platform includes:
âœ… A secure database for customer details, orders, products, admin data, shipping, and tracking IDs
âœ… A user-friendly UI with separate pages for different functionalities
âœ… Features like order management, product listings, and real-time tracking

ðŸ”¹ This project helped me strengthen my Java skills and database management expertise.
ðŸ”¹ Looking forward to feedback from the community!
Would love to connect with others in the e-commerce and Java development space! Feel free to check it out and share your thoughts.
